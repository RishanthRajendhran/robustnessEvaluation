Why?<br /><br />* It supposedly offers insight into something but I was barely able to understand - the surfers surf because apparently it's all they want to do? Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing? Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is apparently a history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. Yet all of them taught me all this movie did not * The movie was decently edited. It flowed fine. The interviews were rubbish though * It's just bumpy from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as poorly crafted as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate it in terms of that.

Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance. <br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as \"\"wooden\"\" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her. <br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever. \".

My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics.

Just because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of the ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee.

A STAR IS BORN isn't the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You kinda experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Although Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together, the music is shallow. When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song, for kids maybe. Also I didn't dig the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty. ). A Star is Born is my least favorite movie.

This is an exercise in enjoyment. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a cute dental hygienist. There's a nice plot. There's sensible logic. There is certainly good acting (and the shark has some quality dialogue too). You shouldn't wonder about anything. You shouldn't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this are so funny. I agree with the previous writer that it is just funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight but a special one.

Politicians with charisma speaking inspirational talk could not be more entertaining. <br /><br />So how was this made? There is obviously great quality control in film! Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this focused experience. <br /><br />It's not hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was even more famous after this kind of exposure.

OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! That would have made this film even better.

A Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Great script, acting and hilariously good special effects make this a must for every movie fan. The horror is hilariously good.

A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns hilarious and novel toward the end of THE BRAIN. Anyone can be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too good a concept, so gritty.
