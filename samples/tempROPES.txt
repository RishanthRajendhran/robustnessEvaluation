Passage: Background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. Situation: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to  charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C.

Passage: Background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Situation: The blood vessels of two different people are being studied at a laboratory. Jim's blood vessels are narrowing, and Bob's blood vessels are widening. This information alone doesn't tell the scientists much about Jim and Bob so they will need to run more tests to see if there are issues with the blood.

Question: In which patient the muscular walls of the blood vessels would not contract, patient A or patient B?
Answer: patient B

Passage: Background: A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction.  A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction. The presence of a catalyst is one of several factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions. (Other factors include the temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants.) A catalyst isn’t a reactant in the chemical reaction it speeds up. As a result, it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction, so it can go on to catalyze many more reactions. Situation: Henry and Tiffany are performing chemical reactions in their high school chemistry class. Henry performs his reactions with the use of a catalyst. Tiffany performs the same reaction with no catalyst present.

Answer: Tiffany

Passage: Background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Situation: Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds.

Passage: Background: Leucism (/ˈluːsɪzəm, -kɪz-/)[1][2][3] is a condition in which there is partial loss of pigmentation in an animal resulting in white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales or cuticle, but not the eyes.[3] It is occasionally spelled leukism. Unlike albinism, it is caused by a reduction in multiple types of pigment, not just melanin. Situation: There is a strange phenomenon going on in Siberia. Biologist noticed that 60 percent of the Siberian Tigers have leucism, and another 40 percent have albinism. They labeled the first group as group A and the latter one as group B. They need to find the reasons for this phenomenon.

Question: Eyes not affected by loss of pigmentation is an important characteristic of which group, group A or group B?
Answer: group A

Passage: Background: "There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time." Situation: The government of Ecuador has been actively pushing to increase biodiversity. They have been quite successful in their pursuit. Moreover, the citizens of Ecuador are receptive about the idea of increased biodiversity. On the contrary, the Government of Oman was not very active in increasing the biodiversity of their country. As a result, Oman, at present, is not very biodiverse.

Passage: Background: Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal and affects all objects in the universe. That’s why Newton’s law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation . Universal gravitation means that the force that causes an apple to fall from a tree to the ground is the same force that causes the moon to keep moving around Earth. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you—your desk, your book, your pen. Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity. You can learn more about Newton’s law of gravity and how he developed it in the video at this URL: Situation: Isaac is sitting under an apple tree reading a book. After a short while he falls asleep under the tree.

Question: Given Isaac bumps into the tree hard enough to dislodge an apple, will it be pulled toward or pushed away from the Earth?
Answer: pulled

Passage: Background: The earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. Situation: Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't.

Passage: Background: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. Situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.
