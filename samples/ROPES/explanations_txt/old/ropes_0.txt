Passage: Background: Flexibility stems from phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism with a given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat, or to move to a different habitat. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on Eucalyptus, and giant pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited—it is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility: "An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better fitted to survive in the new environment," writes evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith.If humans move to a higher altitude, respiration and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also go down. Over a longer period of time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize. Situation: Aaron has discovered two new species of birds living in the Amazon rainforest, Species A and Species B. He is curious as to how flexible these animals are in regards to living in different habitats. To study this, he has tagged two birds of each of the species: For Species A he tagged the birds as A1 and A2, and for Species B he tagged the birds as B1 and B2. He left Bird A1 and Bird B1 in their natural habitat and firstly moved Bird A2 to another habitat and then move Bird B2 to the same habitat. Only the later bird adapted to the new environment.

Passage: Background: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the lower the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gasses, a temperature decrease will produce an increase in the average particle speed. Situation: Jane wanted to make a batch of candy so she put some water, sugar, corn syrup and flavoring in a pot. After turning on the heat she stirred the mixture until it reached 300 degrees Fahrenheit and began to boil. She then turned off the candy and poured it into molds.

Passage: Background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you donâ€™t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weakerâ€”so use it or lose it. Situation: Ann loves running. She ran five miles every day until she broke her leg. After that she had to wear a cast for 2 months where she did a lot of weight lifting instead. When the cast was removed Ann tried to walk and realized that she could not.

Passage: Background: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it decreases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a lower level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid compresses so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get larger when they change from a liquid to a solid.) Situation: Mark hurried in from the cold he had gone shopping for all the supplies he needed for his big Christmas party. He opened the trunk and sat 2 cases of beer in the garage while he carried the food into the kitchen.  Bob put the food away and started dinner. When Mark went out to the garage the next morning he saw that the beer can's had contracted.

Passage: Background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe's neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Situation: When visiting the Galapagos islands Beth was fascinated by the many species of finches. Each had different sized beaks and had carved out its own habitat on the island eating the seeds that were available there. The large-beaked finches lived on the one side of the island with a lot of fruits that required a sizable beak to crack open, the small-beaked finches were on the side where there were a lot of small seeds that require small beaks to pick up.

Questions:
QuestionID: 0
Question: Were the small-beaked finches more or less likely to survive on the side with fruits?
Answer: less
Explanation: Since fruits require a sizable beak to crack them open, small-beaked birds are less likely to survive on the side with fruits.

Passage: Background: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. The Figure below shows how it occurs. The eyeball is shorter (from front to back) than normal. This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina instead of on the retina. Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses. The lenses focus images farther farward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is longer than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in front of the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of in front of it. Situation: Matt liked school and always did well but lately he was having trouble keeping up in class. He usually sat in the back but was having trouble seeing the board. His teacher moved him to the front of the classroom and now he could see the board clearly.
