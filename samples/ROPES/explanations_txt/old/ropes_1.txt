Passage: Background: Abiotic stress, as a natural part of every ecosystem, will affect organisms in a variety of ways. Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have. The higher the latitude of the area affected, the fewer the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area. So, a taiga or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much more susceptible to such stressors. Situation: Ralph is studying the effects of climate change on crop production in order to determine the effects of abiotic stress in different regions. He is studying two farms: Farm A is located in the United States and Farm B is located in Mexico.

Passage: Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, sometimes having no time but sometimes having hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all increase during old age, and the number of brain cells increases as well. The immune system becomes more efficient, decreasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become less common. Situation: Bob and Elaine are neighbors. Elaine goes for a five mile run every morning before work.

Passage: Background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it prevents algae from growing out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may release so much oxygen in the water. Soon, even the algae will die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue, use up carbon dioxide and release much oxygen in the water. If there is no algae, it will create a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Situation: As Mark walked along the field he saw a small pond and walked over to it.  As Mark looked around at the wide open farm land he wondered why lots of fish were there. Once he was closer he noticed that the pond was completely covered with algae.

Questions:
QuestionID: 0

Passage: Background: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains. Situation: Henry is a botanist and has recently discovered two new flowers in a region previously unexplored by humans. He is studying the properties of each plant in order to correctly classify them. So far, he has observed that the pollen from Flower A is harder to find than the pollen from Flower B, which has lower protein.

Passage: Background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1 °C (about 1.3 °F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earthâ€™s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Situation: To help hide from predators the snow hare has evolved to turn white in winter to blend in with the snow. The common hare, however, does not change color throughout the year. But in recent years winters have been warmer and the snow is melting earlier than usual. Without snow on the ground the white hares stand out more and are easy prey for predators including foxes and coyotes.

Questions:
QuestionID: 0
Question: Has the average winter temperature increased or decreased?
Answer: increased
Explanation: Since snow is melting earlier than usual, average temperatures should have increased.

QuestionID: 1
Question: What animal is being harmed by the shorter winter?
Answer: snow hare
Explanation: The snow hare has become an easy prey in winter because of its white appearance as the snow is melting faster than usual now thus leaving it without cover.

Passage: Background: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Situation: Joe ends his work day at 8 a.m. After work he spends time with his family and is usually in bed by 10am. Beth works day shift. She starts work at 11 am. She gets off at 7 pm after having dinner and getting her children to finish homework. She gets some things done around the house and is usually in bed by 10pm.

PassageID: 8
Passage: Background: In nature, when the population size is large, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can hardly reproduce, so the birth rate is low. As the population decreases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will reproduce. Overall, the population can reproduce at a higher rate, so the birth rates rise. This will cause the population growth rate to increase. Situation: The lioness was sitting on a rock looking hopefully out across the flat grasslands. Savannah was in the midst of a drought. Water holes were small and scarce and most of the grass had died. Most of the herds had moved on to other areas. Many of those who hadn't died. 

Questions:
QuestionID: 0
Question: Were the populations of grazing animals decreasing or increasing?

Question: Is food scarce or plentiful for grazing animals?
Answer: scarce
Explanation: Since Savannah is going through a drought, food must be scarce for grazing animals.

QuestionID: 3
Question: Is food scarce or plentiful for lions?
Answer: scarce
Explanation: Since the herds had moved to other areas in search of greener pastures for their grazing animals, grazing animals which are food to the lions must have become scarce.

QuestionID: 4
Question: Is the birth rate increasing or decreasing for lions?
Answer: increasing
Explanation: Since there is a food scarcity, lions would reproduce in higher numbers; birth rates would increase.

QuestionID: 5
Question: Are resources increasing or decreasing for the grazers?
Answer: increasing
Explanation: Since the grazing animals would be reproducing in higher numbers due to the food scarcity, resources would increase for the grazers.

QuestionID: 6
Question: Are resources increasing or decreasing for the lions?
Answer: increasing
Explanation: Since the grazing animals would be reproducing in higher numbers due to the food scarcity, resources would increase for the lions.

QuestionID: 7
Question: Are death rates increasing or decreasing for the lions?
Answer: decreasing
Explanation: Since there is a food scarcity, lions would reproduce in higher numbers; birth rates would increase and death rates would decrease.

QuestionID: 8
Question: Are death rates increasing or decreasing for the grazers?
Answer: decreasing
Explanation: Since there is a food scarcity, the grazers would reproduce in higher numbers; birth rates would increase and death rates would decrease.

QuestionID: 9
Question: Will the lion population increase or decrease if rain comes and grass grows?
Answer: decrease
Explanation: If it rains, the drought would end, also ending the food scarcity. Lions would reproduce in lower numbers which would lead to a decrease of the lion population.
