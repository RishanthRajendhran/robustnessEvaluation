An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as inbred. The avoidance of expression of such deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding, via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, is the main selective reason for outcrossing.[6][7] Crossbreeding between populations also often has positive effects on fitness-related traits,[8] but also sometimes leads to negative effects known as outbreeding depression. However increased homozygosity increases probability of fixing beneficial alleles and also slightly decreases probability of fixing deleterious alleles in population.[9] Inbreeding can result in purging of deleterious alleles from a population through purifying selection.[10][11][12]",
