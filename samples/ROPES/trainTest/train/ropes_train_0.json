        "sentence1": "Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.",

        "sentence2": "Greg and Bobby are coworkers who are currently eating lunch together on their break. They haven't known each other very long and are having a casual conversation when Bobby mentions that he is a hemophiliac. Greg, unsure of what exactly that means, looks confused and taken aback. Bobby, noticing the bewilderment on Greg's face, takes a moment to explain the details of his condition to Greg. Does Greg or Bobby have a lower platelet count?",
        "label": "Bobby",
        "explanation": "Bobby is hemophiliac which would mean that he lacks clotting factors normally released by platelets."

        "sentence1": "There is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98% of non-ionizing but dangerous UV-C and UV-B. This so-called ozone layer starts at about 20 miles (32 km) and extends upward. Some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground (the part that begins above energies of 3.1 eV, a wavelength less than 400 nm) is non-ionizing, but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules, and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions. An example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which begins at wavelengths below 365 nm (3.4 eV), which is well below ionization energy. This property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring. In contrast, visible light and longer-wavelength electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared, microwaves, and radio waves, consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation, and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy.",

        "sentence2": "John was interested in the Sun's radiations that Earth receives. One of the radiations was in the ultraviolet spectrum. He categorized it as spec A. The other radiation was the visible light. He categorized it as spec B. He then searched online to find the pros and cons of each of them. In which case photons would have less energy, spec A or spec B?",
        "label": "spec B",
        "explanation": "Visible light has longer wavelength than radiations in the ultraviolet spectrum and hence they consist of lower energy photons."

        "sentence1": "The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.",

On the other hand, study B showed how decreased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. Rob found the studies very interesting. Which study involved less complex molecules, study A or study B?",
        "label": "study B",
        "explanation": "Study B was about the effect of decrease in greenhouse gases, known to be composed of complex molecules, while study A was about the effect of increase in greenhouse gases."

In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.",

The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels.",

        "sentence1": "We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature \u2013 the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.",

People have actually enjoyed swimming in the water above this newly forming volcano because it is very soothing and relaxing. Given the lava is hot enough to cause some of the water to turn to steam, will the molecules near the lava have higher or lower speed than the molecules further away?",

        "explanation": "Hot lava would increase the temperature of the molecules around it thereby increasing their speed."

        "sentence1": "Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number \u2013 economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies[2][32] have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher. Finland has one of the lowest economic inequality in the world. Finland's neighbor Russia has a different story. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's economic inequality soared to the point that it has now one of the highest economic inequality in the world.",

Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.",

Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 \u00b0C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher.
