        "sentence1": "A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That\u2019s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn't. You would most likely get very sick even if you tried. Ann was fascinated with insects and often kept butterflies or lady bugs in jars. She liked watching them and was always careful to make sure they had food.",
