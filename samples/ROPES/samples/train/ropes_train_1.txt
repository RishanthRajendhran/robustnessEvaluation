Passage: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

Question: A scientist is doing a study in his lab about the radioactivity of some rocks that he found on an expedition. He colored the two different rocks to be able to tell them apart; one Red, and one Blue. He is using a Geiger counter to measure them, and finds that the Red rock causes the Geiger counter to click rapidly, and the Blue causes almost no clicks. Which colored rock most likely has higher radioactivity?
Answer: Red

Passage: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]

Passage: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent.

Question: Tom had a busy day storing XML. At 2 PM, he stored 10 Gigabytes to the database. At 3 PM, he stored 20 Gigabytes to the database. At 4 PM, he stored 30 Gigabytes to the database. At 5 PM, he got dinner. At 6 PM, he stored 40 Gigabytes to the database. At 7 PM, he stored 50 Gigabytes to the database. At 8 PM, he went to sleep to finish storing XML in the morning. What time did CPU load go up: 2 PM or 5 PM?
Answer: 2 PM

Passage: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, "acute" and "chronic." Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3]

Passage: The primary advantage held by a player in late position is that he will have more information with which to make better decisions than players in early position, who will have to act first, without the benefit of this extra information. This advantage has led to many players in heads-up play raising on the button with an extremely wide range of hands because of this positional advantage.[3] Also, as earlier opponents fold, the probability of a hand being the best goes up as the number of opponents goes down.

Passage: Alberta's electrical demand varies throughout the day and across the seasons. When individuals are fixing supper and using home appliances, demand for power goes up, as it does during heat waves and cold snaps. It tapers off during spring and fall. Like other mechanical devices, generators fail from time to time. If they are wind-powered, their output varies with the wind.

Question: Greg works at a power facility in Alberta. He has been charged with regulating generators. His task is to turn on generators in times of high power demand, and to turn off generators at times of low power demand. He tries to remain as efficient as possible. Recently, the area has experienced record cold temperatures on Monday and Tuesday. By the weekend however, the temperature returned to normal, and Friday and Saturday the temperature was very moderate and spring like. Would Greg have turned on more or less generators on Tuesday than Friday?

Passage: The example of someone having a positive experience with a drug is easy to see how drug dependence and the law of effect works. The tolerance for a drug goes up as one continues to use it after having a positive experience with a certain amount the first time.[38] It will take more and more to get that same feeling. This is when the controlled substance in an experiment would have to be modified and the experiment would really begin. The law of work for psychologist B. F. Skinner almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, "a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response.[39]
