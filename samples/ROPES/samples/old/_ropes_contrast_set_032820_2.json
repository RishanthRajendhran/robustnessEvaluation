        "background": "It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is has less kinetic energy as it is absorbed by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules outside to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The decrease in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will collapse. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.",

Stirring is one of several factors that affect how slow a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a lower temperature. For example, sugar dissolves slower in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more slowly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That's because granulated sugar has much less surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs",

Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure increases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is smallest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is greater because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is almost three times that of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, high air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health.",
