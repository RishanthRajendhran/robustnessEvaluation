The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup has less kinetic energy as it is absorbed by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules outside to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The decrease in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will collapse. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Situation: Beth grabbed her container of chili from the fridge and tossed in the microwave for 4 minutes.

If you stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how slow a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a lower temperature. For example, sugar dissolves slower in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more slowly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That's because granulated sugar has much less surface area than a cube of sugar.
