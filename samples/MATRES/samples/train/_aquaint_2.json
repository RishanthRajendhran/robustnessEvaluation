            "bodygraph": "The New York Times said  in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26 :The murder  of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault  on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk  their safety to perform  legal abortions in this country. Slepian was  one of only three doctors who <span style='color:red;'><strong>performed </strong></span>  abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion groups had become  routine over  the past decade . He <span style='color:blue;'><strong>persevered </strong></span>  through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose  whether to bear  a child.But a principled commitment  to provide  a constitutionally protected service  could not stop  the assassin's bullet that tore  through his kitchen window and into his back Friday  night. His death shows  again how tentative the right to abortion has become  in the face of terrorism  by anti-choice fanatics.Their repeated acts  of terrorism must be met  with the severest possible crackdown  by law-enforcement authorities. If an armed police officer has to be stationed  outside every abortion provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done . This is an assault  not only on individual doctors but on the rights and liberties of all Americans. Last week  the FBI joined  Canadian authorities to investigate  a series of unsolved sniper shootings  of doctors in Canada and western New York dating to 1994 . In January , a week after  the 25th anniversary  of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic bombing  in Birmingham, Ala., killed  a security guard and severely wounded  a nurse. Since 1993 , three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been murdered . There have been  more than a dozen attempted murders  of abortion providers in  the last five years . Arson  and bombings  at clinics have become  so common that many no longer make  the national news.It is  bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures are working  to dismantle  reproductive rights by banning  certain procedures , such as so-called partial birth abortion, and by requiring  waiting periods  and parental consent before  an abortion can be obtained . But those restrictions are at least imposed  by the normal give and take of political and judicial struggle  in a democracy.What is  outrageous is the attempt  to shut  down abortions by illegal means _ by shooting  the doctors or bombing  the clinics or harassing  the women seeking  to exercise  their constitutional right. Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced  the bombings  and shootings , but others seem  reluctant to issue  the strong condemnations  that are warranted .Indeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site lists  the names of doctors it says perform  abortions, or ``crimes against humanity,'' with a code indicating  whether they are `` working ,'' `` wounded '' or a `` fatality .'' Such incendiary rhetoric , and frequent accusations  by some anti-abortionists that abortion providers are committing  murder, can only fuel  more terrorism.The increase  of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns  of harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked  to make  abortions harder to obtain . More than 80 percent of counties in this country have  no abortion provider. In 45 states, the number of doctors who performed  abortions declined between 1982  and 1992 .Slepian was  among those who took  a stand against restricting  reproductive freedom and paid  with his life. Unless these brave doctors are better protected , fewer doctors in the next generation will be willing  to place  themselves and their families in such danger. That is what the terrorists want . They must not be allowed  to succeed .",

            "bodygraph": "HAVANA (AP) --In an apparent bid to show  flexibility in the campaign  to return  Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, President Fidel Castro said  the boy's father has offered  to travel  alone today  to the United States to pick  up his 6-year-old son.However, a group trip  with the boy's relatives and classmates appeared  more likely than a solo trip  by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.Gonzalez, the boy's stepmother, his baby half-brother, a dozen classmates and some adults planned  to apply  for American visas today  at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the American mission here. The group would be ready to leave  for the United States as soon as Tuesday , Castro said .Gonzalez said  he would go get  his son alone if U.S. authorities promised  they would turn  Elian over to him immediately and allow  them to fly  back to Cuba right away, Castro said Sunday .''I am willing to leave tomorrow , absolutely alone and transport  myself to where the child is,'' Castro read  from a letter signed  by Gonzalez.''Only the government of the United States can decide if it prefers  this variant,'' continued  the letter, which Castro read  on a state television station broadcast .Gonzalez for months refused requests  by Elian's Miami relatives to go  to the United States to claim  the boy.At the same time, the lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami said  they might try  to argue  that his father is an unfit parent.The White House has said  there is no evidence of unfitness, and the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, said  the ''outrageous'' allegations were a sign the Miami relatives were getting  desperate.It was unclear if American authorities would give  the Cubans the 28 visas they have proposed . The group would not leave  until Gonzalez had assurances that American authorities would give  him custody of his son.The plan is for him and other members of the delegation to stay  in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while awaiting the results of a federal court appeal  by Elian's Miami relatives, who have temporary custody of him and are seeking  to block  his return  to Cuba.In another dramatic move , Castro announced  that the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington was willing to revoke  the diplomatic immunity on his residence, where Cuba has proposed  Gonzalez stay  with Elian and the rest of his family during the federal appeal  -- which could take  as long as a month  or two.Castro said  that if those who oppose returning  Elian to Cuba are worried about turning  the child over to ''what is considered  Cuban territory, then our Interests Section is willing to renounce  diplomatic immunity of the residence of the chief of this section in Washington.''Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war since he was <span style='color:red;'><strong>rescued </strong></span>  off the coast of Florida in late November . His mother was among 11 people who died  after they boat <span style='color:blue;'><strong>sank </strong></span>  during the attempted crossing  from Cuba to the United States.Elian's Miami relatives are fighting  to keep  the boy in the United States, saying  they can give  him a better life off the communist island. Gonzalez has demanded  his rights as the child's sole surviving parent and wants  Elian returned  to him.In its latest deadline, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has given  the Miami relatives until 9 a.m. Tuesday  to sign  a paper promising to turn  over the boy to immigration authorities if they lose  their federal court appeal .The Miami relatives thus far have refused  to sign  the document, and in recent days said  they would not turn  Elian over to his father if he came  to the United States. Earlier, they had said  they would give  the boy to Gonzalez if he made  the trip .Before his Sunday night  address, Castro played  the affectionate grandfather to the 12 first-graders proposed  to go  on the trip , assuring  them that their planned trip  to Washington to retrieve  their little friend was a very important mission .Patting some of the kids on the head, Castro assured  them that they formed  a powerful ''commando.''''Not even the Pentagon can handle  these kids,'' he joked . ''We are hoping  that they get  their visas.''",

            "bodygraph": "The killing  of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo who performed  abortions, has become  a factor in at least two campaigns in New York, say  political consultants and some campaign advisers.In the race  for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, who favors  abortion rights, has moved  quickly to make  the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.And in the tight race  for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat, Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has not raised  Slepian's death himself, his aides say  it puts  a new emphasis on the issue.Slepian was shot  in the back on Friday  night as he stood  in his kitchen. No suspects have been identified . Even before  the killing , Schumer was tyring  to draw  more attention to the anti-abortion record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who is also running  on the Right to Life Party line.In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed on Saturday , 69 percent of those polled said  they did not know  D'Amato's position on abortion, and only 19 percent knew  that he opposed  abortion rights.Now events are doing  the work  for Schumer. Slepian's death was  among the first topics raised  in Saturday  night's debate  between the two men, and it was instantly followed  by a question to D'Amato on whether he opposed  first-trimester abortions for adult women. On Tuesday , the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League plans  to hold  a news conference  to screen  a television advertisement _ made last week , before  Slepian died  _ featuring Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year  in the bombing  of an abortion clinic in Alabama.The advertisement, said  Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended  to spotlight  D'Amato's vote against the 1994  Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act , which Schumer sponsored . The measure made  it a Federal crime to attack  or blockade  an abortion clinic. Now, Ms. Conlin said , it will have  new resonance, and the organization is considering buying  more air time.``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been  regardless,'' she said . ``But sensitivities are  so heightened from the shooting  in western New York that it's even more powerful.''David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is not working  for anyone in this year's campaign, said  abortion `` is  no longer the driving issue it once was , at least on the pro-choice side.''But, Eichenbaum said : ``Sometimes an incident  like this will do more to energize  those who are pro-choice who otherwise might not consider  that as an important an issue to go  to the polls over. It brings  it home.''D'Amato's aides would not comment  about the political ramifications of the slaying , and Schumer's aides would not talk  about whether they planned  to refer  to it in any advertisements, or whether the candidate planned  to use  it on the campaign trail.``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree  this was  a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' said  Josh Isay, Schumer's campaign manager.But, Isay added , ``it heightens  the abortion issue.''Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was  less reticent. ``Eliot is going  to make  a huge priority of this,'' Goldstein said . `` Stopping  clinic violence  is going  to be  a major theme of our campaign from now to Election Day .''In Sunday 's debate  against Vacco, Spitzer attacked  him for failing  to enforce  a court order in 1992  against anti-abortion protesters who had blocked  the entrance to a clinic. It was  the same clinic where Slepian worked .A federal judge removed  Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for western New York, from the case. He was replaced  with two special prosecutors. Spitzer also criticized  Vacco for dismantling  the Office of Reproductive Rights, which investigated  threats and crimes against abortion clinics, when he became  attorney general. On Monday , Spitzer <span style='color:red;'><strong>called </strong></span>  for Vacco to revive  that unit immediately, vowing  that he would do  so on  his first day  in office if elected .Goldstein, who said  it was  ``thoroughly, thoroughly possible'' that the issue would surface  in Spitzer's advertisements, defended  the use of the issue by <span style='color:blue;'><strong>noting </strong></span>  that the attorney general has  direct impact on the issue of clinic access.Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said  in a statement that Spitzer had `` sunk  to a new and despicable low by attempting  to capitalize  on the murder  of a physician in order to garner  votes.''``It's possible that New York politics has never seen  anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness  to exploit  the unfortunate murder  of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions,'' Berhrmann said .Several consultants agreed  that there might be  political hay to be made  in Slepian's death but that it had  to be done carefully.`` Trying  to score  political points from a homicide  can have  a backlash,'' said  Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not working  for any candidate in next week 's election .",

            "bodygraph": "Federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday  that they had concluded  that James Kopp, an impassioned and nomadic opponent of abortion, fired  the shots that killed  a Buffalo, N.Y., abortion-clinic doctor last October .Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found in April  month buried  near the doctor's house and a match  between fibers found  near the murder and others found  in Kopp's car _ officials said  they had decided  to issue  a warrant for his arrest in the killing  of Dr. Barnett Slepian.Kopp, a fugitive, has until now been described  only as a material witness and a nationwide warrant had been issued  so that he could be held  for questioning .There was  no official confirmation of the decision  to upgrade  the warrant, but Denise O'Donnell, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York in Buffalo, has scheduled  a news conference Thursday  to announce  a ``major development '' in the Slepian murder investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, and other investigators will also be  there.Since there is  no federal homicide statute as such, the federal officials said  Kopp could be charged  under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which provides  for a sentence  of up to life imprisonment for someone convicted  of physical assaults  or threats  against abortion providers. If Kopp were also indicted  and convicted  on state murder charges, he could face  the death penalty.Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist who was  the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was shot  to death on  the night of Oct. 23  as he stood  in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst, N.Y. chatting  with his wife and one of his four sons.No weapon was recovered  in the first police searches of the area around Slepian's home. But on April 8 , investigators, wondering  how the assailant could have emerged  from the woods without fearing  he would be seen carrying  a rifle, searched  the site of the shooting  once more and unearthed  a rifle buried  one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home.Clark, the Erie district attorney, <span style='color:red;'><strong>said </strong></span>  afterwards that investigators think  the doctor's killer buried  the rifle in  the days before  the shooting , unearthed  the weapon to fire  the fatal shots, then hurriedly reburied  it and fled .The 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs <span style='color:blue;'><strong>appears </strong></span>  as gaunt and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses were  in Vermont and New Jersey, emerged  as the focus of the investigation within two weeks  of the slaying . A jogger observed  Kopp's car at 6 a.m . near Slepian's home 10 days before  the murder , and, curious  why a stranger would be parked  there so early, wrote  down the license plate number.",

Castro declared .The demonstrators, wearing  T-shirts with Elian's portrait, waved  red, white and blue Cuban flags on the shore of the community of Niquero, where the Granma landed on Dec. 2, 1956 , with 82 armed men led  by Fidel Castro.In the years  that followed , the guerrilla fighters waged  war on the troops of dictator Fulgencio Batista, <span style='color:red;'><strong>declaring </strong></span> victory on Jan. 1, 1959  when Batista <span style='color:blue;'><strong>fled </strong></span>  the country.Castro noted  the importance that Cuba's younger generations have played  in the communist government's battle  to secure  Elian's return  from the United States, where the boy's Miami relatives are fighting  for permanent custody.As a father and the grandfather of eight children -- including a boy who just turned  6, the same age as Elian -- Castro said  he sympathized with the little boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.Gonzalez has cited  his rights as the child's sole surviving parent in his calls  for his boy to be returned  to him in communist Cuba. Elian's mother and 10 others perished  when their boat sank  off the coast of Florida in late November  during a crossing  from Cuba to the United States.''Elian today  is the symbol of our unity,'' Castro said  to cheers.''And our struggle will not end  with the return  of Elian,'' added Castro. He said  the Cuban people would continue  to protest  American laws and policies aimed  at Cuba, including a four-decade economic embargo and continued  U.S. military presence at the Guantanamo Naval Station on the easternmost end of the island.",
