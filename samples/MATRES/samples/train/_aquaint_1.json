But an INS spokeswoman said  the agency would revoke  Elian's permission to stay  in the United States, <span style='color:blue;'><strong>clearing </strong></span>  the way for his return  to Cuba.In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said  that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would travel  to the United States to bring  his son home after  the custody battle  has been decided  in the courts. Elian's father would be accompanied  by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts, Castro said  on Cuban television.``We have the perfect formula for reinserting  Elian,'' Castro said . He also said  that the group would be willing to wait  as long as it takes to bring  the boy back.Asked to comment  on Castro's announcement , a Justice Department spokesman said :``Certainly it changes  things. How it changes  things is a little hard to say  at this point. If the father shows  up in Miami and decides to go  and ring  the doorbell of his relatives and find  his son, well, the family in Miami is on record as saying  they would turn  over Elian to him.

            "bodygraph": "HAVANA (AP) --President Fidel Castro declared Wednesday night  that it is just matter of days before Elian Gonzalez will be reunited  with his father.''I am talking  about three days '' more or less, Castro told  hundreds of university students from across Latin American and the Caribbean in town for a regional congress. ''It is inevitable.''''The battle  of Elian has been won  -- in judicial terms, in legal terms, in political terms,'' Castro said  as he wound  up his speech  at Havana's Karl Marx Theater.Castro's statement came  less than an hour after Gregory Craig, attorney for Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, announced  in Washington that the father would be traveling  to the United States Thursday  with his wife, their 6-month-old son, and with Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.''This courageous father will leave at 4 in the morning  ( 4 a.m. EDT Thursday ),'' Castro said . ''And I, at least, will be there to see  him off.''He said  the group would be met  on arriving  in Washington by Craig and Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who traveled  with Craig on his lightning trip  to Havana on Wednesday .The Cuban leader said  that the U.S. government still did not know  how it would transfer  Elian to his father, but that it would happen quickly.The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said  earlier this week  that once Gonzalez arrives  in the United States it will begin  the process to transfer  Elian to his custody from the Miami relatives who have been caring  for him since he was rescued  off the coast of Florida in late November .The Miami kin has been <span style='color:red;'><strong>battling </strong></span>  to keep  him in the United States, <span style='color:blue;'><strong>saying </strong></span>  it can give  him a better life off the communist island. But Gonzalez, backed  by Castro, has demanded  his rights as Elian's sole surviving parent and insisted  that the child be returned  to him.Elian's mother perished  along with 10 others when their boat sank during  the crossing  from Cuba to the United States. Since the tragedy , Elian has become  a political poster boy for Cubans with diametrically opposed  ideologies living on both sides of the Florida Straits. During  his speech Wednesday night , Castro expressed  irritation that much of the rest of the delegation was not granted  visas to travel  to the United States to stay  with Elian while waiting  out a federal appeal filed  by Elian's Miami relatives and assist  in his ''rehabilitation.''''More important than the doctors are those 12 children'' from Elian's first-grade class in Cuba, Castro said .Cuba had asked  for 28 visas for the trip , for Elian's father, his stepmother, his little half-brother, a 5th grade boy cousin, the dozen classmates, and a host of teachers, doctors and other specialists.Also on the list was National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who has served  as adviser to Gonzalez over the past four months  and a senior member of Cuba's communist leadership.Ultimately, U.S. officials approved  and delivered  six visas, for the four family members, a pediatrician and Elian's teacher from his year in kindergarten.",

            "bodygraph": "MIAMI _The angry crowd rushed  at Manuel Gonzalez as he stepped  out of Miami's federal courthouse, shaking  fists at him and shouting  in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''But the great-uncle of 6-year-old shipwreck  survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ducked  his head and walked  faster.In a drama that has divided  his once close-knit family and may finally be resolved  in a court hearing the week of March 6 , Manuel Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out of the glare of television lights.Until this week .He was thrust  into the middle of the swirling  Gonzalez family saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, sent  a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno asking  that his son be moved  to Manuel Gonzalez's home.Alone among his two brothers and two sisters who have fled  Cuba for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez believes  Elian should go  back to Cuba to live  with his father.Reno denied  the request , but Manuel Gonzalez didn't back  down.In a town where expressing  even the slightest approval for Cuban President Fidel Castro can prompt  threats of physical harm, Manuel Gonzalez <span style='color:red;'><strong>filed </strong></span>  a motion in federal court <span style='color:blue;'><strong>asking </strong></span>  for custody of Elian so that he could help reunite  the boy with his father in Cuba.It was a move that many see  as courageous and principled, but others fear may be foolhardy.``I have lost  a son,'' Gonzalez told  reporters later, referring  to his own son's death  due to cancer. ``I am supporting  Juan Miguel because I know  what it is to lose  a son. Elian should be with his father.''His sincerity didn't stop  the talk on Little Havana's streets or on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which buzzed  with callers lambasting  Gonzalez for playing  into the hands of a tyrant.A day after he was hounded  on the steps of the federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't come  to the door of his modest home in Miami's Little Havana.``He must go  to work ,'' said  his daughter, Rosa, who said  Gonzalez would prefer  not to talk  about the issue. ``There has been a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''After weeks of high-profile public sparring  _ with charges of abuse , spying  and treachery flying  back and forth across the Florida Straits _ it would seem  the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever heal  the wounds created  by the Elian saga.But the family has overcome  steep obstacles before. Long before Elian thrust  them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the conflicts  and painful separations wrought  by the Cuban revolution .Of the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five have come  to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has passed  away.According to press reports , Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister, was the first to come  to the United States, arriving in 1966 . Her brother Delfin, who was imprisoned  as an anti-Castro activist in  the 1960s , followed in 1979 . Then came  another sister, Georgina, in 1983 , followed  by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984 .Of those who stayed  in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan Gonzalez, seems  the most closely allied with the Cuban government. He worked  as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that probably helped  his son _ Elian's father _ get  a job in the Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.The family's experience  is like that of thousands of others now  split between Miami and Cuba, said  Damien Fernandez, a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University.``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the post-1959  politics have managed  to split  thousands of families apart,'' he said .For decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely cut  off from the families they left  behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors'' by Castro, many weren't able to speak  to _ much less visit  _ their relatives for years .The situation began  to relax  in the early 1990s , with the crisis triggered  by the end  of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In desperate need of hard currency, Castro relaxed  travel restrictions and allowed  Cubans to have U.S. dollars, triggering  a trickle of cash from Miami that soon became  a flood.By some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and elsewhere in the United States _ send  $1 billion a year  in remittances back to their families on the island.``The Miami families have become  a lifeline, and since 1990  there has been a great trend toward reconciliation ,'' said  Florida International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still divided by politics, they have learned  to forgive  and forget  and find  common ground.''Prior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different. The branches of the family regularly talked  by telephone and the Miami relatives went  back to Cuba for several family reunions .But Elian's case has broken  down the family's fragile truce, with their political differences exacerbated  by the inflammatory rhetoric flying  between Castro's government and exile extremists in Miami.After making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ostracized  by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been keeping  Elian and who has gone  to court to try  to keep  the boy here.But there has been at least one attempt  at a resolution . The day before last Tuesday 's federal court hearing , Manuel went  to Lazaro's home to try  to work  out their differences. Neither side would say  what happened , but when Manuel returned  to his house, he was so upset he felt  heart palpitations and was taken  to a hospital.He was soon released  and appeared  to be reasonably healthy when he appeared  in court the next morning . But while Cuban exiles outside the courthouse cheered  Lazaro and his family, their angry taunts seemed  to shock  Manuel.His lawyer, however, insists  he will continue  to stand  up for what he thinks  is right.``He's a strong man,'' said  Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't let  anyone intimidate  him from doing  what is in Elian's best interests.''To his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has issued  a statement asking  Miami's exiles to respect  his brother's opinions.Manuel Gonzalez has told  reporters that he believes  his family will recover  _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case has brought .``The wounds of the problem will heal ,'' he told  the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''",

            "bodygraph": "MIAMI (AP) --In efforts to prevent  Elian Gonzalez's return  to Cuba, an anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed  him Friday  to testify  before a congressional committee and one of his Miami relatives sought  to become  his legal guardian.Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said  he subpoenaed  6-year-old Elian to testify  before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10 , so he remains in the country while the courts consider  his case.About 100 supporters cheered  wildly as Elian -- holding  the subpoena in front of his face while being held  aloft by a relative -- appeared  outside the house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave  the peace sign before heading  back indoors.But in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said  during a news conference  in his hometown of Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and immigration has said  that I am the only one who can speak  for him``Why should it be delayed ? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''Elian was found Thanksgiving Day <span style='color:red;'><strong>clinging </strong></span>  to an inner tube at sea after  his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned  while trying  to reach  Florida by boat.The boy was <span style='color:blue;'><strong>placed </strong></span>  with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday  that he must be returned  to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14 . The decision touched  off protests  in the Cuban-American community.Burton, the committee's chairman, said  in a release he `` issued  a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure  that no precipitous action is taken  until the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address  the Gonzalez case.''Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996  law named  for him and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened  the 1959  trade embargo  against Cuba.Committee sources who spoke  on the condition of anonymity said  that while the subpoena requires  that Elian attend  the hearing  in Washington, it's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought .``The Congress of the United States is affording  Elian Gonzalez what INS and this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due process,'' said  Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation. ``This gives  him the protection that he will not be repatriated  to Cuba between now  and Feb. 10 .''Earlier Friday , lawyers filed  a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt  by his Miami relatives to get  guardianship and then to file  for applications for admission to the United States and asylum, said  David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before  the judge's ruling , which is expected early next week .In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people rallied  in a seaside plaza Friday night  to demand  his return . ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang .Also Friday , Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied  by one of the family's lawyers, flew  to Washington to appeal  directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked  President Clinton to reverse  the INS order.Reno said  she is considering  the issues raised  in the meeting  and the state court action.``I plan to respond  as quickly as possible,'' she said  in a statement.Reno has said  she was consulted  on the INS decision  and approved  of it. Clinton said Friday  the INS did the right thing.``I believe  they followed  the law,'' Clinton said . ``This is a volatile and difficult case. ... We need  to keep  this out of the political process as much as possible.''In contrast to Thursday , when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people were arrested  and police were forced  to use  tear gas to disperse  a crowd, protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday .However, the Cuban exile community called  for more civil disobedience. About 100 protesters marched  in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday night , waving  Cuban and American flags and chanting  ``Cuba libre'' and ``long live the USA.''Two men carried  a banner that said  ``President Clinton, Please keep  Elian in the United States.''Protesters planned a large demonstration  in Little Havana on Saturday  and were planning to drive  around Miami International Airport on Monday .``If the child is sent  back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is going to break  loose,'' said  Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an anti-Castro group.The rally  in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked  by songs, tears and personal recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held since early December , when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised  mass mobilization  until the boy was returned  to his father.Elian's father, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began weeping  as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang  of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked  particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying .During the day Friday , Elian played  in his relatives' yard with a puppy named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased  Elian around the yard and playfully nipped  at his blue soccer shorts.``Elian tells  me he does not want  to go  back to Cuba,'' said  Delfin Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said  Elian wants  his family to come  here.",

For weeks  the communist government has held  such rallies  almost daily .``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40 years  of the blockade, armed invasions , sabotage  and attempts  to kill  President Fidel Castro were for earlier generations,'' said  Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written  several books about Cuban emigration to the United States. After  the rally , state television showed  the Cuban exiles in the streets of Miami -- some of them carrying  signs demanding  ``Freedom for Elian,'' the same battle cry regularly chanted during rallies  on this side of the Florida Straits.A voiceover to the footage called  the exiles ``criminals'' and ``mafia members.''Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting  ``Liberty! Liberty!'' blocked  intersections and cut  off access to the Port of Miami. In one case, riot police had to use  tear gas to clear  them.Saying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's return , Cuba's government exhorted  citizens to keep rallying , after  the boy's relatives in Miami said  they would look  for ways to get  around Wednesday 's ruling  by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to repatriate  the child by Jan. 14 .Cuban exiles in Miami will now  `` proceed  with all their resources to impede  or delay '' the ruling , Cuba predicted Wednesday .``We cannot stop mobilizing !

            "bodygraph": "WASHINGTON (AP) --The Justice Department is reviewing  whether alcohol-related driving violations  or other actions  by Elian Gonzalez' relatives in Miami warrant moving  the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.``That matter is under review,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said  when asked Thursday  about the violations . ``We will look  at that, try  to make  some kind of factual determination and then decide  what steps, if any, need  to be taken .''In addition, the department is still considering  a request last week  from Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody shifted  from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami.Juan Miguel Gonzalez objected  to the media access to Elian that Lazaro Gonzalez's family has permitted  and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists selected  by Lazaro Gonzalez's family.Meantime, the possibility of a meeting  between Attorney General Janet Reno and Lazaro Gonzalez's family reemerged Thursday . Reno agreed  to a meeting  earlier this week , only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family withdraw  the request. But discussions  have been renewed , a Justice official said Thursday .Later Thursday , two of Elian's Miami cousins sought  support on Capitol Hill for legislation that would help keep  the boy in America. One of them, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told  a news conference  that reports of alcohol-related violations  by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.``We're doing  what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close family,'' she said .Another cousin, Georgina Cid, said  Elian's father had intended  to flee  Cuba himself, but was being coerced  by the Castro government to stay  and make  certain statements.``He wanted  to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba,'' Cid said . She said  she and other family members had spoken  to Elian's father by phone both before and after the mother perished .The father's response when learning  that his boy was safe in Miami was `` take care  of him until I can go , meaning go  to the United States,'' Cid said .A group of Florida lawmakers introduced  legislation this month  to grant  Elian American citizenship, which would take  the decision  about Elian's future  away from INS and give  it to a Florida family court. Support for the bill has been waning .Reno has already met  with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and a Catholic nun from Miami who oppose  his return  to Cuba, as well as with Elian's two grandmothers from Cuba, who want  him returned .In Havana, Elian's father joined  President Fidel Castro on Thursday  in a packed  auditorium in what has become  a daily  public rally  to press  for the boy's return . Speaker after speaker denounced  the United States and extolled  the virtues of Cuba's communist revolution .A Justice official, who requested  anonymity, said  the department has authority, if necessary, to shift  temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy was placed  in his care after  being found clinging  to an inner tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving following  a boat wreck  that killed  his mother and 10 other people.The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled  in favor of the father's request  that the boy be returned  to him in Cuba, but that decision  was <span style='color:red;'><strong>put </strong></span>  on hold while the Miami relatives battle  in federal court to keep  him in this country.Holder said  that INS <span style='color:blue;'><strong>acted </strong></span>  appropriately but `` now  that we have this new information, we'll have to look  at it, and see , like I said , what steps if any are appropriate.''Florida state records show  Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was found  guilty of driving  under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997 . Records also show  Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been found  guilty at least twice of driving  under the influence. On Wednesday , Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Castro's key man for U.S.-Cuban relations, said  the convictions prove  the homes of those uncles are no place for Elian.``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the future , joining  the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of the child,'' Alarcon told  reporters in Havana. He said  Elian was ``surrounded by two drunks.''Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, dismissed  the criticism : ``Elian is surrounded by love.'' Elian's relatives and other Miami supporters say  his mother died to give  him freedom.The newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily  Gramma, published  a letter Thursday  from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner asking  for Elian's return .``No material good exists  that can compete  with the value of the family, and it is humiliating for us that people are still questioning  our love and the future  that awaits Elian at his home,'' said  a Spanish version of the letter, dated Feb. 4.",
