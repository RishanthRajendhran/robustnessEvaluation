Passage: AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) --A rifle found  near the home of a slain abortion doctor may yield  important clues for investigators trying  to track  down the gunman.Dr. Barnett Slepian was  *killed*   in his kitchen by a sniper's bullet last fall . Investigators said Friday  they  *found*   a rifle buried  near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst.The gun was sent  to the FBI laboratory in Washington to determine  whether it was used  to kill  Slepian.``If it 's  not too badly rusted, they may be able  to match  the bullet back to the weapon,'' said  Walter Rowe, forensics sciences professor at George Washington University.The rifle might also have  clothing fibers, fingerprints or a serial number that can be traced  to the buyer, Rowe said . Buried  a foot beneath the ground, the weapon was unearthed during  a search  of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday . Investigators did not say  how close the weapon was  to the house.Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought  as a material witness in the shooting .Investigators said  Kopp's car was seen  in the neighborhood in  the days before  the slaying . Kopp vanished after  the shooting , and the car was found abandoned  at the Newark, N.J., airport in December .Officials said  DNA test results showed  a likelihood that a strand of hair discovered  behind Slepian's home came  from Kopp.

Passage: BUDAPEST, March 12  (Xinhua) --Hungary's accession  to NATO has brought  about new changes to the political balance in central and eastern Europe, shattering  the world configuration under the Yalta accord since  World War  II, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said  here Friday .

Passage: WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) --President Bill Clinton Thursday condemned  terrorist bomb attacks  at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed  to find  the bombers and bring  them to justice."No matter what it takes, we must find  those responsible for these evil acts  and see  that justice is done," Clinton said  at the ceremony  marking the return  of remains of Americans who were killed  in the Kenya embassy bombing .The ceremony  was held  at Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, where 10 of 12 American victims of the Kenya embassy bombing  were brought  back by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.Clinton said  the United States will not retreat  from the world because of terrorist attacks .Albright, echoing  the president, said  the United States would " continue  to be present around the world, wherever we have interests to defend .""We will  *do*   all we can to protect  our diplomatic and military peoples around the world," she said .Clinton met  with his top aides Wednesday  in the White House to assess  the situation following the twin bombings  at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which have killed  more than 250 people and  *injured*   over 5,000, most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians.

Passage: NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _Terrorist bombings  at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania  *blew*   apart buildings and buses, trapping  people under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers cleared  with cranes, blow torches and bare hands.At least 82 were killed  and more than 1,700 injured , officials said  as dawn  *broke*  Saturday . Dozens of people were still missing , however, and the death toll was expected  to rise , they said .The suspected car bombings  occurred 700 kilometers (450 miles) from each other but just minutes apart on Friday , turning  busy streets in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel.``This appears  to have been a very well-coordinated, very well-planned attack  _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said  in Washington. No one has claimed  responsibility.The blast  in Nairobi occurred at about 10:35 a.m.  (0735 GMT) Friday , toppling  a crowded building toward the embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least 75 people were killed  and 1,643 wounded  there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said .

Passage: NEW YORK (AP) --A man whose house was allegedly a bomb factory was arrested  in connection with last year 's deadly U.S. Embassy blasts  in Kenya and Tanzania and was brought  to the United States for trial .The suspect -- Khalfan Khamis Mohamed -- was scheduled  to appear  before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan at midday , according to a statement today  by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.The latest arrest brought  to nine the number of people in custody in connection with the bombings .White heads  a team that is investigating  and prosecuting  the bombings  which killed  224 people, including 12 Americans, on Aug. 7, 1998 .Mohamed, 24, allegedly rented  a house in his native Tanzania which was used  as a bomb factory.In Cape Town, South Africa, police spokesman Capt. Rod Beer  *said*   the FBI  *arrested*   Mohamed at the city's airport in the early hours of Thursday morning  as he was about to be deported  for being in the country illegally.The Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town reported  that a search  has been launched  for accomplices in the region.The U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, had no comment.Seventeen people have been indicted  in the case.

Passage: With the finding  of a buried rifle 11 days ago , the authorities in the Buffalo, N.Y., area say  they have gathered  enough evidence in the October slaying  of Dr. Barnett Slepian to begin presenting  a murder case to a state grand jury as early as next week. A federal grand jury has already been addressing  the slaying  under laws that prohibit violence  against providers of abortion. Slepian was  the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic before  he was shot  to death last Oct. 23  at his home in suburban Amherst. But the decision  by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to begin presenting  evidence to a state grand jury suggests  that he has amassed  enough material to support  a criminal indictment for homicide.``We've gotten  to the point where we know  what we want  to introduce  before a grand jury,'' Clark said  in a telephone interview Monday .Although the authorities are not saying  who the suspect is , all of the attention so far has fallen  on James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester who had been traveling  around the country from demonstration to demonstration for years .Officially, Kopp is being sought  as a ``material witness'' in the case.Clark said  it was easier to seek extradition  of an indicted suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone wanted  as a material witness. For now, though, that would be  a theoretical advantage since the authorities have admitted  they have  no idea where Kopp is .Clark said  there was ``no question'' that the finding  of the rifle was  important in his decision  to seek  an indictment . The rifle was discovered April 8 buried  one foot below the ground, about 200 feet behind Slepian's house. It is undergoing  testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington, but the authorities have said  it resembles  the kind of high-powered rifle used  in the slaying .Clark  *said*   other evidence that prosecutors might present includes  a strand of human hair found  at the wooded firing site that has a ``high likelihood'' of matching  Kopp's hair and testimony from a jogger who spotted  Kopp's car near Slepian's house at 6 a.m. ten days before  the shooting . There also are videotapes of Kopp's car crossing  the Canadian border around  the days  _ in 1994 , 1995  and 1997  _ that three Canadian doctors who  *perform*   abortions were shot  at. None of those doctors were killed .If a suspect is caught  and charged  in both state and federal courts, a state trial would likely precede  a federal one, giving  the authorities two chances to prosecute . New York State double-jeopardy laws would make  it difficult to prosecute  a suspect who had been found  not guilty at a federal trial.U.S. Attorney Denise E. O'Donnell declined  to discuss  what federal charges were being pursued , but she said  that in a case like this, potential charges would be  abortion-related violence , the use  of a firearm in an act  of violence, crossing  state lines to commit  a crime, and, if the suspect's act was tied  to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which prohibit  an organized criminal enterprise.Slepian, 52, and the father of four boys, was shot  to death at 10 p.m . as he stood chatting  with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in Amherst, which is  the largest Buffalo suburb.

Passage: WASHINGTON _The bombings  at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have frightened  away travelers from East Africa just as Kenya was hoping for an end to a years-old  slump in foreign tourism, and as Tanzania was finally beginning  to reap  the benefits from a major investment in the travel industry.Tour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and Tanzania, which boast some of Africa's best game parks and sunniest beaches, say  there have been no mass cancellations  as a result of the Aug. 7  Embassy bombings  in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which left  more than 250 people dead.But they report  a number of worried calls  from prospective travelers, many of them alarmed by the possibility of more terrorist attacks  in the region. ``People have been calling , and we've been reassuring  them that we don't see  further problems,'' said  Mary Mkimbo, a spokeswoman in New York for the Kenya Tourist Office.The State Department, which does not want  to see  Kenya and Tanzania punished economically as a result of terrorist attacks  that were clearly  *targeted*   at the United States, has lifted  dire travel warnings issued  just the bombings  that  *urged*   Americans to stay away from the two countries. New public announcements put  out on Aug. 13  suggest only that Americans ``exercise caution'' when visiting  Kenya and Tanzania.Embassy employees in both cities have gone  back to work , although in new locations. The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is expected  to be demolished  after the FBI has finished gathering  evidence. The embassy in Dar es Salaam suffered  less damage from the blast , although it, too, may have to be razed . For now , the State Department says , Embassy employees can offer  only emergency consular service.Foreign visitors to Nairobi and Dar es Salaam since the bombings  have noted a reassuringly heavy presence of both police and soldiers on the streets of the two capitals. Crew-cut FBI agents fill many of the luxury hotels in the two cities.Western diplomats and intelligence officials say  there is no reason to believe  that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who is accused  of organizing  the Embassy bombings , plan to strike  again soon in either country.Still, the televised images of the charred hulks of the American Embassy buildings will likely haunt the travel industry in East Africa for years. ``The tourism industry is very sensitive to the news media,'' said  Ms. Mkimbo. ``We do expect  a little downward movement in the industry.''The tourism industry in Kenya has been troubled for years _ in part because of the opening  of new safari destinations in South Africa, in part because of Nairobi's well-deserved reputation for street crime. Tourism industry revenues reportedly dropped  to $300 million last year , down from $450 million the year before.The government has responded  to the slump with a series of actions  to lure  tourists back, including a marked improvement in the service of Kenya Airways, the national airline, which has gone  into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The bombing  will doubtless set  back those efforts.Tourism has never been so well-developed an industry in neighboring Tanzania, which is home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the magnificent wildlife of Serengeti National Park and the exotic island of Zanzibar.But the lack of infrastructure has worked  to Tanzania's advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number of adventure travelers who are willing, even eager to go  without the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers. The number of visitors to Tanzania jumped  from fewer than 100,000 in 1980  to more than 300,000 last year , prompting the government to improve  roads needed for safari tours.``Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for years, and they're beginning  to develop  it now ,'' said  Jalal Ebrahim, president of Safaricentre International, a tour operator in Manhattan Beach, Calif. ``There were fewer people in the parks in Tanzania, and that's what attracted visitors. It was more pristine.''Ebrahim, whose company has been sending  American travelers on East African safaris for 13 years , said  that his company had received  only one cancellation  as a result of the embassy bombings  _ and that he did not expect  many more.``We had one cancellation  from a couple who decided they were just going to wait  and see  what happened,'' he said . ``Our clients are adventure travelers and most of them are very savvy. They read  a lot, they stay on top of world events.'' They understand , he said , that increasingly terrorism knows no borders.The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi is now  operating out of the offices of the Agency for International Development on The Crescent, in the neighborhood of Nairobi known as the Parklands; (254-2) 751-613. The Embassy in Dar es Salaam is at 285 Toure Drive; (255-51) 666-015.
