                "question": "Another brilliant third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's great the episode lived up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a nice thing to 'show' the alien, as its actual visage leads to such a daunting build-up; and then we get the Star Trek psychedelic light display used for many number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress. ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode and it is well directed and comes across as yet one more well executed show of the series' last season",

The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) kills the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few beers and avoid this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

The script is rightly just as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old clich\u00e9 about it \"\"only happening in the movies\"\" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, bringing the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets really help however, and so does director Feist's obvious feel for the material. Then add a final car chase hitting it right off with both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty sweet. In fact the movie picks up a lot in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. So glad that Tieney's career gelled so well. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one piece of brilliance after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project could have been even better as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a decent too. \"",
