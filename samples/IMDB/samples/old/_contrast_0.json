Why?<br /><br />* It supposedly offers insight into something but I was barely able to understand - the surfers surf because apparently it's all they want to do? Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing? Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is apparently a history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. Yet all of them taught me all this movie did not * The movie was decently edited. It flowed fine. The interviews were rubbish though * It's just bumpy from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as poorly crafted as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 1/10",

Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The trick here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance. <br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as \"\"wooden\"\" is well said. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her. <br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke do not capture any interplay between Jane and Rochester. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester.

Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.",
