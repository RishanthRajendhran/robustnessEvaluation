The strident background music is beautiful and adds to any lucid moment.

No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. But these criminals can't stay on the street. The state would be doing the community a disservice. Unfortunately, the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day.
