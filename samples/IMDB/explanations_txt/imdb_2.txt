Question: This makes a lot of sense, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's his screen presence that lends it even higher credibility. I'm glad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually elevated to starring in high standard projects like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly even better than the good old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to make this gel even better. The strident background music is beautiful and adds to any lucid moment. Though apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from and you won't really be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article. <br /><br />Yes, there are better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out but this is good so also give this a shot, as you would want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Positive
Explanation: The reviewer was impressed by Karloff’s acting and the apt use of background music to elevate scenes. They suggested that the movie is worth a watch.

Question: Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article. <br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer called the movie “low grade rubbish”. They felt that the music was a huge distraction and the dialogue delivery of the Mexican cast was poor.

Question: "This program is really underrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character should have won an Emmy years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Moreover, there are Vietnam veteran characters who turn out to be killers. I would like to see more black murderers, they always seem to be put up to it by their white bosses. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. A great story. Only on this show are the murderers of both upper-class whites and lower-class ethnic minorities. <br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago is good propaganda: serve your time folks. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. But these criminals can't stay on the street. The state would be doing the community a disservice. Unfortunately, the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Positive
Explanation: The reviewer considers this work award-worthy. They also felt that the film is giving out a good message.

Question: "This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the ""rubber gun squad"" years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites. <br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer found the plot and the characters laughable. They also felt that the content was propaganda against upper-class whites.

Question: I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides tearing my face each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is a joke. He is SO ropy. Even the P. C. brigade would find this flat. It's a missable watch, and even more if you could've instead gone with the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so unlike him, even if you close your eyes you won't believe it's him singing. The things he describes are fantasies to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate real humour over this. Anyway, highly recommended the drinks, hope you enjoy. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer found the standup terrible. They suggested that the standup be given a miss because none of the jokes were even remotely funny.

Question: Sloppy script, woeful direction, slightly better than average performances, unknown cast, random use of locations. <br /><br />Paul McGann gives a OK performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously. <br /><br />There is a disappointing moral & ineffective journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Predictably they cross over. Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO would have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's even working?<br /><br />.

Passage: "Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being ""turned off"" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him.

Questions:
QuestionID: 0
Question: Did I mention how creepily good Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just great. To make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her. err. I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really funny. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he ""drops in"" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for its comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions. ""I heard another Dave & Mary song!""".

Question: Dan Katzir has produced a film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a nonsensical romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel. <br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the horrific uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so annoying. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify this awkward feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply saddened. <br /><br />It's hard to write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this so bad its hard to replicate. If you have an ounce of passion, don't crush your soul by seeing this film. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative

Question: <br /><br />Haim, the drug abusing child star of the 80's is amazing as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all above average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very mind stimulating plot. <br /><br />All in all, please watch this unless you hate 80's movies, Corey Haim, or unlike myself, hate old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to instead watch crappy movies.

Question: Old movie -I despised it. All the editing and use of the soundtrack. It fails to capture the real feeling of Indian life, we can't relate. A cast with some missing characters. The movie develops none of the characters so that you don't really care about them all and you feel like you don't know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is okay and the direction sometimes works as everyone comes off as natural. But, you still can't force yourself to root for Jess in this film! The acting was really bad, especially the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very unconvincing as someone that played lots of soccer. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer was clearly unconvinced with the characters’ mannerisms in the movie. They were of the opinion that it fails to capture the essence of Indian life and that none of  the characters were built enough for the audience to care about them.

Question: I was grossed by the ugly photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska (or at least they say so). Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely but weirdly depicted in the story. The hunting sequences were from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, and these were disturbing. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a cheap documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which was weird even for the documentary flavor. The film-makers try *too* hard to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles which takes away from it. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see all the times they had makeup on. And they were just average in their roles yet they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is not worth a look. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer was dissatisfied with the cinematography. They also pointed out many inconsistencies in the claims made by the makers and the final product. They also were not impressed with the actors in the film.

The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating.

The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Positive
Explanation: The reviewer was satisfied with the cinematography and the documentary flavor of the film. They also were impressed by the actors and the attempt to authentically portray the lives of the eskimos.
