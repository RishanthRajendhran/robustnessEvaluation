Question: I rate this 1 out of 10. Why?<br /><br />* It supposedly offers insight into something but I was barely able to understand - the surfers surf because apparently it's all they want to do? Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing? Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is apparently a history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. Yet all of them taught me all this movie did not * The movie was decently edited. It flowed fine. The interviews were rubbish though * It's just bumpy from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as poorly crafted as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate it in terms of that. So 1/10. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer was not impressed by the story which they found to be shallow. While they did not have complaints with the editing, they did not seem to understand what the point of the movie was.

Question: Good choice in your dreams. <br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I hated this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The trick here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance. <br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is well said. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her. <br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke do not capture any interplay between Jane and Rochester. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the best romance novel ever. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer regrets having spent time watching the movie. They also felt that it lacked the nuances that the novel, whose adaptation the movie is, had.

Passage: We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money's worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.

Question: <br /><br />Unfortunately,the critics were right on this one. This movie is very bad. not just bad but very bad. The critics are a bunch of geniuses. They hated the nudity and language and so did I. It wasn't worth the price of the ticket (free for me!!). Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. But this was miles from it. Sharon Stone is ugly and does a poor job in the movie and it confirms to me that critics are sometimes right. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer agrees with the critics’ poor opinion about the movie. They felt that the movie had unnecessary nudity and poor acting.

Question: I swear when I saw this movie,I wanted to take my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN isn't the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You kinda experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Although Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together, the music is shallow. When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song, for kids maybe. Also I didn't dig the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty. ). A Star is Born is my least favorite movie. This movie is tough to watch and is a dream-breaker at the end. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer calls the movie a bad watch and felt that the songs were shallow. She deems it to be her least favourite movie.

Question: "I gave it a 8 instead of a 9 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is better. This is an exercise in enjoyment. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a cute dental hygienist. There's a nice plot. There's sensible logic. There is certainly good acting (and the shark has some quality dialogue too). You shouldn't wonder about anything. You shouldn't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this are so funny. I agree with the previous writer that it is just funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight but a special one. Or a weirdly good painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall beautifully. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?

Question: This movie was so good I could sit through it without doing something else. There was a dense plot and plenty of points. I thoroughly enjoyed it and for a film about a stand up comedian, I could recall so many jokes and funny lines worthy of the description. Politicians with charisma speaking inspirational talk could not be more entertaining. <br /><br />So how was this made? There is obviously great quality control in film! Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this focused experience. <br /><br />It's not hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was even more famous after this kind of exposure. He was so funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?

Passage: You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep. I can explain, I think!! Well.

Question: <br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrific film? A Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Great script, acting and hilariously good special effects make this a must for every movie fan. The horror is hilariously good. The post production team knocked it out of the park. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be bad! But it can't! <br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns hilarious and novel toward the end of THE BRAIN. Anyone can be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too good a concept, so gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the best acting I have seen.
