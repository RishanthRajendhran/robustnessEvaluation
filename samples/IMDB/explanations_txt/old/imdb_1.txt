Question: Another brilliant third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's great the episode lived up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a nice thing to 'show' the alien, as its actual visage leads to such a daunting build-up; and then we get the Star Trek psychedelic light display used for many number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress. ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode and it is well directed and comes across as yet one more well executed show of the series' last season. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Positive
Explanation: The reviewer found that the episodes lived up to the incredible premise and felt that the season was well executed.

Question: Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress. ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety.

This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.

Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer found that the episode did not live up to its premise and that it was a badly executed season.

Question: "This slick and gritty film consistently fails to deliver. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I hated GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters worse then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) kills the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few beers and avoid this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Negative
Explanation: The reviewer dubbed it the worst film of the director and suggests that the movie be given a miss.

Question: "Tierney's an authentic tough guy, and this movie just picked up from normally competent RKO sells his impact at every turn. The script is rightly just as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, bringing the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets really help however, and so does director Feist's obvious feel for the material. Then add a final car chase hitting it right off with both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty sweet. In fact the movie picks up a lot in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. So glad that Tieney's career gelled so well. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one piece of brilliance after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project could have been even better as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's decent too. ". What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?

Question: "Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants.

Question: "This movie starts slow, then picks up. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolute action happen, I watched it even more eagerly. I mean, a lot happened. A lot. Hoo. Tada. This is the story. The characters are very interesting representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film should be knighted in a court of kingdom when they sell this motion picture. There is a lot to unpack. I can't imagine to tell the same story even with these pictures with captions. The script is a wonder. It's just incredible. I doubt that any script writer in the world could match it. My biggest regret is not that I missed attention for 60 minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to pay attention, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people pay more attention before me. ".

Question: "This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it.

Question: "I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I don't believe my life anymore. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Interesting, good acting, a bit slow, the script is not too predictable, the music is interesting, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nu-cu-ler"" incident, the movie began to go into places. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, and I totally found it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, that's your movie.

Question: I'm usually not one to say that a film is worth an award, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The major upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short. <br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably riveting and goes really deep throughout the film. Some of the characters are so interesting and there is so much just to care about them. I can now see why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, i had earlier thought he should have definitely passed on this one. <br /><br />One of the reasons I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for dessert though. <br /><br />Well, if you by some miracle end up skipping this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy whatever you watch more than I did this. Thanks for reading. What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?
Answer: Positive
Explanation: The reviewer was impressed with the riveting plot of the movie which they considered award-worthy. They also found the characters interesting.
