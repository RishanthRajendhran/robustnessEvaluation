        "passage": "On 31 January 1919, because of the pressure from the Triple Entente representatives, the attack on Skocz\u00f3w was cancelled, and the Czechoslovak army ceased fighting. The Czechoslovak army withdrew to the new Green Line, established by the International Commission Agreement on the basis of the Czechoslovak-Polish Treaty, concluded on 3 February 1919 in Paris. On 30 January 1919 Josef \u0160nejd\u00e1rek had received the order to cross the Vistula and secure the railway line between Bohum\u00edn and Jablunkov. They crossed the river and the Polish troops retreated to Skocz\u00f3w, where the front line was stalled. Further Czechoslovak reinforcements arrived, which gave \u0160nejd\u00e1rek an advantage over the Polish units. The Czechoslovak army prepared for an attack on Skocz\u00f3w assuming that it would lead to the collapse of the Polish defenses. Earlier, Cieszyn Silesia was occupied without a fight on 27 January 1919. All this had started on 23 January 1919 at 11:00 in Cieszyn Silesia when Polish commander Franciszek Latinik and Czechoslovak officer Josef \u0160nejd\u00e1rek met with a group of officers, consisting of English, French, Italian and U.S. representatives . The Polish side was given an ultimatum, that they evacuate the area to the Bia\u0142a River in less than two hours. After the expiry of this period the Czechoslovak army started its operations at 13:00 following its operational guidelines to seize Bohum\u00edn and Karvin\u00e1. From the east, at the same time, an attack was launched by the Italian legionnaire unit. The Czechoslovak army moved forward, and took Bohum\u00edn , Orlov\u00e1 and Karvin\u00e1.  Polish troops retreated to the river Vistula.",

In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as Dolphins QB Chad Pennington completed a 53-yard TD pass to RB Patrick Cobbs.  The Texans would respond with kicker Kris Brown getting a 27-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Miami added onto its lead as Pennington completed an 80-yard TD pass to Cobbs.  Houston would answer with Brown kicking a 33-yard field goal and WR Jacoby Jones returning a punt 70 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the Texans took the lead with QB Matt Schaub completing a 12-yar TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Dolphins replied with RB Ricky Williams getting a 5-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Houston regained the lead as Brown got a 42-yard field goal, yet Miami struck back RB Ronnie Brown got a 6-yard TD run.  Fortunately, the Texans got the last laugh as Schaub got the game-winning 3-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion). With the thrilling win, Houston won its first game of the season and improved to 1-4.",

The Treaty on 5 March 1626, restored the pre-1618 peace. Jurisdiction was nominally restored over the Valtellina; this was now recognized as Catholic, which strengthened its autonomy and introduced doubt as to who could decide on transit through the valley. Papal troops replaced the French though the forts were supposed to be destroyed. Monz\u00f3n represented a serious reverse for Richelieu who blamed his envoy for the terms and feigned illness to avoid seeing the furious Savoyard ambassador. Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In the spring of 1625 they regained Bahia in Brazil and Breda in the Netherlands from the Dutch, which turned into a situation with important qualifications. In the autumn they repulsed the English at Cadiz.",

Cabess was a formal and loyal ally to the British Royal African Company and assisted their operations in the region. The Dutch, in competition with the Royal African Company, had a series of disputes with Cabess including an instance in 1684 with the Dutch panyarring Cabess and taking his goods. The disputes intensified in November 1694 when Cabess invited the British Royal African Company to return to Komenda and then attacked Dutch miners outside of the city. With the British reoccupying the former British fort in Komenda they were fired upon by the Dutch fort. As a result of these hostilities, the British, Dutch, and Eguafo king began contacting possible allies in surrounding African kingdoms to prepare for a war. Cabess Terra and Twifo initially joined the Dutch, but this alliance was stopped when Denkyira threatened to attack Twifo if war should break out. The Adoms took money from Eguafo to remain neutral in any fighting. War broke out in February 1695 when the forces of John Cabess attacked the Dutch fort and prevented reinforcements. On April 28, 1695, the Twifo forces were defeated. The war then largely took the form of panyarring where one force would seize members of other groups regularly. A short-lived peace settlement was reached in the end of 1695, a few months after an unfortunate incident when the Dutch head at the fort, Willem Bosman, drew a pistol and attempted to shoot at Cabess.",

There was also a Jewish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500. After the occupation by Nazi Germany, a census was made by the German authorities in December 1939. 71% of people declared themselves as Poles, 188,000 people declared Kashubian as their language, 100,000 of those declared themselves Polish.",
