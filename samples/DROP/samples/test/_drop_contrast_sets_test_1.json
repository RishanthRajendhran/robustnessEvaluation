Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industrys proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York Citys finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.",

During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki during 1783-1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. This was after the first census carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358.  Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century; from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate Replacement fertility rate.",

The Browns would get on the board with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 37-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cleveland started to rebound as QB Derek Anderson completed a 5-yard TD pass to RB Jamal Lewis for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Arizona responded with Warner completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson. The Browns would reply with Anderson completing a 67-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals increased their lead with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 33-yard field goal. Afterwards, Dawson gave Cleveland a 22-yard field goal, yet Arizona answered with Rackers completing a 19-yard field goal. At the end of the game, the Browns had one final chance to win it all. Winslow caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Anderson in the corner of the endzone just beyond the goal line.",

The Treaty on 5 March 1626, restored the pre-1618 situation with important qualifications. Jurisdiction was nominally restored over the Valtellina; this was now recognized as Catholic, which strengthened its autonomy and introduced doubt as to who could decide on transit through the valley. Papal troops replaced the French though the forts were supposed to be destroyed. Monz\u00f3n represented a serious reverse for Richelieu who blamed his envoy for the terms and feigned illness to avoid seeing the furious Savoyard ambassador. Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In 1627 they had their most famous victory in repulsing the English at Cadiz.  They also had a number of smaller victories, including regaining Bahia in Brazil and Breda in the Netherlands from the Dutch in the spring of 1625.",

In the second quarter, Minnesota got into a tiny hole, as Bills RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run. Longwell would give the Vikings a 49-yard field goal as time ran out of the first half, but in the third quarter, the Vikes found themselves in a bit of a hole, as Buffalo QB J. P. Losman connected with WR Peerless Price on an 8-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota trailed even further, as Bills kicker Rian Lindell got a 28-yard field goal. The Vikings would try and comeback, as QB Brad Johnson completed a 29-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. The two-point conversion failed and during their next drive, they ran out of time.

Anderson ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 7-6.  In the second quarter, the Bengals moved back into the lead when Dalton found Alex Erickson on a 29-yard pass to make it 13-7 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Broncos came within 3 when Brandon McManus kicked a 45-yard field goal to make it 13-10.  Though in the fourth quarter, the Bengals moved up by double digits when Dalton found A.J. Green on an 18-yard pass to make it 20-10.  The Broncos then concluded the scoring of the game when Brock Osweiler found Demaryius Thomas on a 17-yard pass to make the final score 20-17. With the win, the Bengals improved to 4-6.  The team also won against the Broncos in Denver for the first time since 1975.",

The Lithuanian National Revival emerged during the 19th century and the movement to establish an independent nation-state intensified during the early 20th century. On November 11, 1918 Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. Earlier on February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the re-establishment of independence from all previous legal bonds with other states. Lithuanian territory was occupied by Germany during World War I from 1915 until the war ended in January 1918. The declaration asserted the right to self-determination, meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. The publication of the Act of Independence was initially suppressed by the German occupation forces, but on March 23, 1918, the Germans acknowledged the declaration; their plans had shifted to the establishment of a network of satellite countries. However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, police force, or civic institutions. The first national government, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, was formed. Voldemaras issued a declaration that Lithuania did not need a military force, as it was not planning to engage in warfare, and that only a small militia was needed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted.",

The Treaty on 5 March 1626, restored the pre-1618 situation with important qualifications. Jurisdiction was nominally restored over the Valtellina; this was now recognized as Catholic, which strengthened its autonomy and introduced doubt as to who could decide on transit through the valley. Papal troops replaced the French though the forts were supposed to be destroyed. Monz\u00f3n represented a serious reverse for Richelieu who blamed his envoy for the terms and feigned illness to avoid seeing the furious Savoyard ambassador. Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In the spring of 1625 they regained Bahia in Brazil and Breda in the Netherlands from the Dutch. In the autumn they repulsed the English at Cadiz.",
