During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki during 1783-1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. This was after the first census carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358.  Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century; from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years old or younger.

Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In 1627 they had their most famous victory in repulsing the English at Cadiz.

The Lithuanian National Revival emerged during the 19th century and the movement to establish an independent nation-state intensified during the early 20th century. On November 11, 1918 Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. Earlier on February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the re-establishment of independence from all previous legal bonds with other states. Lithuanian territory was occupied by Germany during World War I from 1915 until the war ended in January 1918. The declaration asserted the right to self-determination, meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. The publication of the Act of Independence was initially suppressed by the German occupation forces, but on March 23, 1918, the Germans acknowledged the declaration; their plans had shifted to the establishment of a network of satellite countries. However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, police force, or civic institutions. The first national government, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, was formed. Voldemaras issued a declaration that Lithuania did not need a military force, as it was not planning to engage in warfare, and that only a small militia was needed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted.",
