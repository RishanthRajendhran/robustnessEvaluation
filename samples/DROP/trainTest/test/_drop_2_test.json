Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on March 1, 1565, and fought the Frenchmen for two more years. Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his uncle, on January 20, 1567, he imposed final defeat on the French forces and decisively expelled them from Brazil, but died a month later from wounds inflicted in the battle. Coligny's and Villegaignon's dream had lasted a mere 12 years. Largely in response to the two attempts of France to conquer territory in Brazil , between 1612 and 1615, the Portuguese crown decided to expand its colonization efforts in Brazil. Prior to this in 1560, Mem de S\u00e1, the new Governor-General of Brazil, received from the Portuguese government the command to expel the French. With a fleet of 26 warships and 2,000 soldiers, on 15 March 1560, he attacked and destroyed Fort Coligny within three days, but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and defenders, because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Native Brazilians, where they continued to live and to work. Admiral Villegaignon had returned to France in 1558, disgusted with the religious tension that existed between French Protestants and Catholics, who had come also with the second group.",

        "sentence1": "Coming off yet another close win, this time over the Falcons, the Saints went home for a Week 15 Saturday night duel with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Dallas would get off to a fast start with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 49-yard TD pass to wide receiver Miles Austin. The Cowboys then increased their lead later in the quarter with a 3-yard TD run by running back Marion Barber. In the second quarter, the Saints would score their only points of the half with kicker Garrett Hartley nailing a 34-yard field goal. However, the Cowboys took a 17-3 lead at halftime with kicker Nick Folk's 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas scored the period's only points when running back Marion Barber got a 2-yard TD run. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. New Orleans got the first score of the period when running back Mike Bell scored a one yard TD run to make a 24-10 Dallas lead. Following a Dallas three-and-out, New Orleans made it a one touchdown game when quarterback Drew Brees hit wide receiver Lance Moore for a 7-yard TD pass. Dallas then marched down the field to the Saints' eight-yard line, but then kicker Nick Folk's game-icing 23-yard field goal hit the mark. However, unlike in such games against Washington and Atlanta, quarterback Drew Brees was sacked with 10 seconds left in the contest at the Dallas 48-yard line, forcing a fumble for the second time in the game by Dallas' DeMarcus Ware, which was then recovered by nose tackle Jay Ratliff. The Cowboys then took a knee to end the game. With the loss, the Saints fell to 13-1, ending their chance at a perfect season. Also with the Colts' win, the Saints held the 2nd best overall record of any team.",
