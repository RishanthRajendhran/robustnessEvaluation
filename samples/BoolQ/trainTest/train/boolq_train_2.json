The record for most repeated championships stands at 10, held by Ernst van Dyk in the Men's Wheelchair division. In the Men's Open division, Clarence DeMar holds the distinction of most wins with seven, and Catherine Ndereba tops the Women's Open division with four. The United States has had more winners than any other country, followed by Kenya and Canada. The United States and Canada dominated the early years of the race, and it was not until the 36th race, in 1932, that someone from outside North America, Paul de Bruyn of Germany, won the race. During the period from World War II through the 1980s, there was much more national diversity among Boston Marathon champions, but the last two decades have seen Kenya emerge as the dominant nationality, especially in the Men's Open division, which (as of 2015) has been won by Kenyans in 19 of the past 25 years.",

        "sentence1": "A new design for one pound notes was introduced in 1960, with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962. These new series C notes were slightly narrower, and were the first one-pound notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front. The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England. Series C notes were replaced by the series D notes from 1978 onward. These slightly smaller notes featured an entirely new design with Queen Elizabeth II on the front and scientist Isaac Newton on the back. The note was redesigned slightly in 1981 to feature brighter background colours. Following a consultation with retailers and other groups it was announced on 31 July 1981 that the one pound note would be replaced by a one pound coin. Part of the reason for this change was that notes, on average, lasted only nine months in general circulation, while coins could last forty years or more. The government also believed that the growing vending industry would benefit from the introduction of a one-pound coin. The new cupro-nickel coin was introduced on 21 April 1983 and the one pound note ceased to be legal tender on 11 March 1988. Bank of England \u00a31 notes are still occasionally found in circulation in Scotland, alongside Royal Bank of Scotland \u00a31 notes. This is because Scotland has no concept of Legal Tender, and any Sterling bank note, of any age, may be used provided the trader is content to accept it. The Bank of England will exchange old \u00a31 notes for their face value in perpetuity.",
