There are three main sections that define thermal stratification in a lake. The epilimnion is closest to the water surface and absorbs long- and shortwave radiation to warm the water surface. During cooler months, wind shear can contribute to cooling of the water surface. The thermocline is an area within the water column where water temperatures rapidly decrease. The bottom layer is the hypolimnion, which tends to have the coldest water because its depth restricts sunlight from reaching it.  In temperate lakes, fall-season cooling of surface water results in turnover of the water column, where the thermocline is disrupted, and the lake temperature profile becomes more uniform.", "QuestionID": "3091949598", "sentence2": "Boris is deploying a camera probe in a lake to observe the different kinds of fish species that reside in each layer during the summer.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \"fit\" to survive in a particular environment and have \"adapted\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time.

You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures.", "QuestionID": "2367518700", "sentence2": "Jane worked at a bottling company she liked her job but her favorite thing was to watch as carbon dioxide was added to the soda to make it fizzy.
