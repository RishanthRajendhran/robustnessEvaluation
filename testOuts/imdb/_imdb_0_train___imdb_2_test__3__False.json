I'm glad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually elevated to starring in high standard projects like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly even better than the good old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to make this gel even better. The strident background music is beautiful and adds to any lucid moment. Though apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from and you won't really be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article. <br /><br />Yes, there are better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out but this is good so also give this a shot, as you would want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!.

A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the \"\"rubber gun squad\"\" years ago.

Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a \"\"race traitor\"\" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites. <br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers. \".

The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny.

The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify this awkward feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply saddened. <br /><br />It's hard to write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this so bad its hard to replicate.

The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural.

Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
