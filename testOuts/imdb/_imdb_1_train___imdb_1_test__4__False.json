[{"PassageID": "1_0", "sentence1": "", "QuestionID": "1", "sentence2": "Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress. ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.

It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking \"\"but I hated GET SHORTY\"\" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the \"\"feel\"\" for Leonard's characters worse then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) kills the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few beers and avoid this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday. \".

The script is rightly just as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old clich\u00e9 about it \"\"only happening in the movies\"\" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, bringing the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets really help however, and so does director Feist's obvious feel for the material. Then add a final car chase hitting it right off with both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty sweet. In fact the movie picks up a lot in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. So glad that Tieney's career gelled so well. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one piece of brilliance after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project could have been even better as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's decent too. \".

After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a \"\"motion\"\" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same \"\"story\"\" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching \"\"Love In the Time of Money\"\", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader.

I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced \"\"nuclear\"\" as \"\"nu-cu-ler,\"\" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the \"\"nu-cu-ler\"\" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here.

Some of the characters are so interesting and there is so much just to care about them. I can now see why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, i had earlier thought he should have definitely passed on this one. <br /><br />One of the reasons I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done.
