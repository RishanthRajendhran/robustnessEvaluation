Nevertheless, several professional opinions suggest that gentle usage initially may assist with smoothing clutch engagement and reducing wear on internal components - although some argue that extreme care must always be taken not to overrev the engine due to potential harm caused thereby. Ultimately, determining exactly why certain practices are recommended versus others requires further research, especially since the majority of contemporary cars come equipped with computerized transmissions designed specifically around preventative maintenance protocols to reduce overall mechanical stress placed onto these devices prior to reaching their service life expectancy limits. Generously speaking, those recommendations remain uncertain due largely to possible damaging parts, and thus require special attention until it has been suggested as applicable to avoid prolong the useful to cause severe damage until it has a valid recommendation period.
