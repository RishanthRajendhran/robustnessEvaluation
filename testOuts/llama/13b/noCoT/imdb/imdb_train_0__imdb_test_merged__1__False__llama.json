It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred.

It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians destroyed in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so inappropriately, the people in the roles seem like actors--not minors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated deplorably in a dance hall scene) and WWI \"\"conspire\"\" to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The plot is a good criticism of xenophobia the film is not, it tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred partly. It was a egregiously distorting film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best.

The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer.

To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered.

The Europeans are normally well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is an anomaly. \"\"Werewolf Woman\"\" seems to have an intense sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun not just the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very fiesty quickly. Shes not a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film has its tones set, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather impressive character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />Also, there are plenty of entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a so many nice gore effects and nude scenes. And, these don't become monotonous any soon.
