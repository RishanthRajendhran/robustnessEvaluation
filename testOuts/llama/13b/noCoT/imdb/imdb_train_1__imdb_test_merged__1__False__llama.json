Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. And, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is still the best. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. And when you put that aspect into the film, it becomes one big jocky ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, and when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he naturally doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would reasonably be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem.

It has a made for big-screen feel, with plenty score including the title character's own theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"\"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\"\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then immediately they develop a friendship. Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her but then its not made today. The social commentary on Indians could have been developed more seriously. I am too not at all surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage and I feel capitalized on the same.

Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (\"\"Godzilla King of the Monsters\"\"), \"\"Gammera the Invincible\"\" gets nothing more but the spelling wrong. The American scenes are just as sagacious and pleasant as those added to the great Gojira, and add much to the story as well since there is detail follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, the film begins to ascent into a fairly experimental kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The major thing going for it here, of course, is that there is little to nothing that's not original about this film. Gamera, similarly, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - all of these are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.\"", "QuestionID": "0", "sentence2": "What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?", "label": "Positive", "explanation": "", "output": "Neither\n\n### Review:\n\"A lot of people don't seem to understand why this movie got such high ratings.

In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is.

First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time b\u00eates noires. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of abomination. Where 99.9% of movies these days are at least entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us fiction, gives us his fantasies, gives us an alternate version of history to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio goes further and looks school shootings right in the face, yet unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, promoting propaganda from the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. And it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves would come off either way, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find even worse conspiracies in what happened. Its true that sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, but we are shown that these boys are us and we them. That society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real. Untrue<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man but this is not the way to convey it.

They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the poor Polly Walker who bears a very weak resemblance to a very vamp Louise Brooks (and that too just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so shallow and has nothing but spring and an underwhelming, dreamy sugary sweetness it almost preordains it, and this is unacceptable; it's turns out as the movie it wants to avoid being. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a dead soul of wood, just full of quiet moments and no wonder.\"", "QuestionID": "0", "sentence2": "What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?", "label": "Negative", "explanation": "", "output": "Negative\n\n### Review:\n\"\"Alien\" is a science fiction horror masterpiece.

For me, the only allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. In all Life Pod is much worse than other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and much predictable.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cutesy, and completely inaccurate.

I got so frustrated with the series I threw out my collection of the comics and bubblegum cards (still hate them !) to forget. I even had the View Master slides... I had an innocent urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I had the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I hated it even more. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I hate them all now and the occasional demonic soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I was forced to watch \"\"Return to the bat cave\"\"... it was a misery to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight but this TV movie is simply gross in every other aspect. They however play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />Shame on the people who produced this disgusting \"\"nostalgic feast\"\"... I'm never gonna watch it again.

It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack.

At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track tries and fails to make it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly awful. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but, they probably didn't contribute to this while, which helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably failed and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more proactive than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a garbage cartoon and is well worth avoiding. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. I recommend to burn it, particularly if you like good animation.\"", "QuestionID": "0", "sentence2": "What is the sentiment of this review: Positive or Negative?", "label": "Negative", "explanation": "", "output": "Negative\n\n### Review:\n\"A great movie.
