The theory of cognitive dissonance was developed by psychologist Leon Festinger in his 1957 book When Prophecy Fails. According to Festinger, when inconsistent thoughts arise, individuals tend to become psychologically uncomfortable and they have a motivational drive to reduce this tension. They do so by changing their attitudes, beliefs, and actions. For example, if someone believes that they are always right, and then they make a mistake, they might try to convince themselves that they were right all along, despite the evidence. Alternatively, they could change their behavior to avoid making mistakes in the future.\nQuestion: is cognitive dissonance related to anxiety\nThe answer is True.\n###\nPassage: The term ``cognitive dissonance'' refers to the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an"}, {"PassageID": "0_17", "sentence1": "Anosmia is the inability to perceive odor or a lack of functioning olfaction--the loss of the sense of smell.
