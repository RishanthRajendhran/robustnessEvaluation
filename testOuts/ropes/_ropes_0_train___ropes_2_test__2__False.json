Since the organisms were previously undiscovered, James must determine how these organisms reproduce in order to correctly classify them. After examining the DNA of each offspring, James finds that the offspring of organism A shares the exact same DNA as the parent organism and the offspring of organism B does not contain the exact same DNA as the parent organism.", "QuestionID": "3", "sentence2": "Did organism B reproduce sexually or asexually?", "label": "sexually", "explanation": "", "output": "The offspring of organism B does not contain the exact same DNA as the parent organism, so it reproduced sexually.
